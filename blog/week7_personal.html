            <span class="first-letter">G</span>roup projects are always interesting. All of our previous Ada projects have been either individual or in pairs, and lasted about a week. This most recent one was a group of 4, spanning two weeks, and I was terrified when it came to who would be in my group!
          <p>
            It pains me to say it, but there are a few people with whom I would really rather not work. I feed off of people's energy, and some of my classmates are pretty high-stress, intense folks. This isn't the sort of environment in which I prefer to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully, fate was good to me this time around, and my group was absolutely wonderful. By the end of it, even though it had been an incredibly stressful project, we were all still friends. Some other groups had a lot of bickering, and ours was not one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be honest, though - I'm really happy to be done with this project. It was the first one where I didn't satisfy all of the requirements, but I'm. Just. Done. I had intended to do some more work on it, and that might end up happening, but for now, I just want do anything but work on an e-commerce site! (And, if you're wondering, the quokka pictured above was one of the products featured on Zoolily, our site.)
