          <p><span class="first-letter">2016:</span> a year in review</p>
          <p><strong>1. What did you do in 2016 that you’d never done before?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Moved to the Pacific Northwest
            </li>
            <li>
              Started a software developer bootcamp
            </li>
            <li>
              Started learning poi (I'm still awful)
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked my last wedding
            </li>
            <li>
              Went to a concert by myself
            </li>
            <li>
              Agreed to be a bridesmaid
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>2. Did you keep your new years’ resolutions and will you make more for next year?</strong></p>
          <p>I don't make resolutions.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</strong></p>
          <p>No one super close, but I have one friend with a rapidly approaching due date.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong></p>
          <p>No, but far too many people not close to me did.</p>
          <p><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong></p>
          <p>None, sadly.</p>
          <p><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2017 that you lacked in 2016?</strong></p>
          <p>More travel to other countries.</p>
          <p><strong>7. What date from 2016 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</strong></p>
          <p>August 8th - it's the day that Ada started.</p>
          <p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</strong></p>
          <p>Getting accepted to Ada.</p>
          <p><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong></p>
          <p>Not getting the internship company I wanted.</p>
          <p><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong></p>
          <p>Nothing major.</p>
          <p><strong>11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong></p>
          <p>Tickets home for Christmas. I missed my family, friends, and pets a lot.</p>
          <p><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong></p>
          <p>Ian's. I still can't believe that he's handled my being away for a year as well as he has, and that he's willing to move wherever I find a job after I graduate. He's my rock. Home is where he is.</p>
          <p><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong></p>
          <p>Those who voted for Trump. I don't understand how millions of people could get behind a platform of so much hate.</p>
          <p><strong>14. Where did most of your money go?</strong></p>
          <p>Putting a new roof on our Pittsburgh home.</p>
          <p><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong></p>
          <p>Ada.</p>
          <p><strong>16. What song will always remind you of 2016?</strong></p>
          <p>Weirdly, "Father Figure" by George Michael. It's be running through my head nonstop since he died.</p>
          <p><strong>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Fatter or thinner:</strong> Fatter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Richer or poorer:</strong> About the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Happier or less happy:</strong> About the same.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>18. What do you wish you’d done more of?</strong></p>
          <p>Seeing Ian and my pets.</p>
          <p><strong>19. What do you wish you’d done less of?</strong></p>
          <p>Ordering take-out. It's delicious, but expensive and unhealthy. Alas, not having a kitchen in Seattle greatly affects that goal.</p>
          <p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
          <p>Ian and I went to Nat and Laura's and we ate a ridiculous quantity of food with their kids. It was fantastic and exactly what I needed.</p>
          <p><strong>21. Did you fall in love in 2016?</strong></p>
          <p>Over and over again with the same person.</p>
          <p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
          <p>I like all of the NCIS variants and Code Black.</p>
          <p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year?</strong></p>
          <p>Trump.</p>
          <p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
          <p>This wasn't a good year for book reading, unless it's a nerdy computer programming language book.</p>
          <p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery of 2016?</strong></p>
          <p>I am so, so ashamed, but Bieber isn't as offensive as I'd initially thought.</p>
          <p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
          <p>Admission to Ada.</p>
          <p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
          <p>The internship company I wanted.</p>
          <p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of this year?</strong></p>
          <p>Deadpool</p>
          <p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
          <p>I turned 38. Because CMU's Carnival happens over my birthday, we never really do anything specifically for my birthday. This year, though, there was a Sigma Nu reunion dinner on my actual birthday, which was cromulent. More meaningful, though, was that the Mercers scheduled their son's birthday party for a day that I could attend, which was the weekend before my birthday. That was incredibly awesome of them.</p>
          <p><strong>30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
          <p>Seeing more of Ian and my pets.</p>
          <p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2016?</strong></p>
          <p>Lazy.</p>
          <p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
          <p>Facetime.</p>
          <p><strong>33. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</strong></p>
          <p>I don't know that "fancy" is the right word, but I'm really going to miss Obama.</p>
          <p><strong>34. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
          <p>Trump and his platform of hatred.</p>
          <p><strong>35. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
          <p>Ian.</p>
          <p><strong>36. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
          <p>Alex.</p>
          <p><strong>37. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2016:</strong></p>
          <p>Despite being married, I can still get by on my own, but Ian is home. Being away from him is way harder than I thought it would be.</p>
