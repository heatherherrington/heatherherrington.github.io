            <span class="first-letter">O</span>nce upon a time, I was hired for my perfect job. It was for a company that made a customizable application for progressive political organizations and non-profits. It was remote. It used my favorite stack - Ruby, Rails, and React. And I was wrong.
          <p>
            Much to my surprise, I missed communicating with clients and customers. I missed translating technical jargon into things a non-tech person could understand. I missed my lists and my ability to come up with alternate plans if a deadline could not be reached.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ended up getting laid off after some "for sure" clients didn't sign contracts. Initially, I was devastated. Eventually, though, I realized it was a blessing in disguise. It was an opportunity to find something that truly meshed with my skill set.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that's been my goal ever since - to find that magical unicorn of a job. I've narrowed it down to either Project Manager or Developer Advocate. Both have elements of what I truly enjoy and I believe I could excel at either one. Now, it's just a matter of finding the ideal company.
