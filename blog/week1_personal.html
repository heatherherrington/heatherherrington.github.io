            <span class="first-letter">W</span>ords cannot communicate how excited I am right now. I've been in Seattle, away from Pittsburgh people and pets (barring one short weekend home for a wedding), for roughly two months. Tonight, I take a red-eye home and get to stay there for an entire week.
          <p>
            Roughly an hour and a half after I land, I have a birthday party for a 5-year-old to attend. There will be a bounce house and likely quite a few small children. I will have just spent the previous ten hours on a plane, in an airport, or in a car. It's going to be rough. Hopefully, there will be beer.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the birthday party, it's homeward bound to see my dog and cats. I expect at least seven solid minutes of spazzing from my dog. Any less will leave me disappointed.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then! Some friends are coming over for drinks, after which we'll be off to <a href="http://harrisgrill.com/">Harris Grill</a> for food and Frozen Cosmos. Yes. Frozen Cosmos. They are basically slurpees for grown ups. If you have never been to Pittsburgh, you don't even know what you're missing. And this is only day one!!! I legitimately might explode.
