            <span class="first-letter">W</span>hile I've been home, I've been trying to get a little ahead and learn about Rails, since we'll be covering that starting on Monday at Ada. I bought <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Head-First-Rails-Learners-Companion/dp/0596515774/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474750526&sr=8-1&keywords=Head+First+Rails">Head First Rails</a>, because I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Head-First-Ruby-Jay-McGavren/dp/1449372651/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474750564&sr=8-1&keywords=Head+First+Ruby">Head First Ruby</a> so much. Alas, my cats did not appreciate my studying effort. See the above picture for proof. Cats are jerks.
          <p>
            As far as the book goes, I unfortunately didn't make nearly as much progress as I'd hoped, as it's super outdated. A lot of the commands don't even work anymore, including how to even start the server. I view this as a lesson to read the reviews, rather than just go by what I've thought of previous books from the same series. Thankfully, I had another book to keep me busy.
          </p>
          <img class="blog-image" src="../images/algorithmbook.JPG" alt="grokking algorithms book cover" />
          <p>
            In addition to learning about Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript, the curriculum at Ada covers CS Fundamentals, so I was happy to find an algorithm book I really like - <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474750787&sr=8-1&keywords=grokking+algorithms">Grokking Algorithms</a>. Plus, it must not taste as good as my Rails book, since my cats didn't eat any of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book covers quite a bit of information in a really friendly format, including entertaining pictures. The first few chapters, which cover subjects like Big-O notation, selection sort, and recursion, are things we've already covered in Ada, so it's an awesome way to dig deeper and make sure I really understand those concepts. This is going to be my travel reading for my plane rides and layover times tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it!
