            <span class="first-letter">M</span>any apologies to anyone actually reading this. Ada has been kicking my booty lately, and this post is about the best I can pull off right now.
          <p>
            We're doing our internship interviews this week. I had zilch today, but then it ramps up - Tuesday: Pivotal Labs; Wednesday: Isilon and Amazon AWS Learning and Certification; Thursday: Amazon AWS Solutions Architecture; Friday: Spare5 and Samsung. Pivotal Labs is an hour-long pair-programming exercise. The rest are a half hour, and I'm anticipating soft skills questions and white boarding, but the companies are free to do whatever they wish with the time they're given.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our input as students, we were given a survey and asked to indicate our top four choices, as well as answering a plethora of other questions. Stuff like "Would you ideal company already have an Adie working there" and "Do you prefer a larger company". For most of these questions, I had no preference. And I seriously lucked out - I got all four of my top picks, as well as two more that are mostly not objectionable.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the start of Ada, we were told to not get our hearts set on one company, and to trust the process. I failed. I have a company I really want. And that's all I'm revealing for now. We won't know our companies until likely January, so fingers crossed until then!
